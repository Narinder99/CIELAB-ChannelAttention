# Multi-Label Image Classification

This repository contains an implementation of a multi-label image classification system using the ResNet model for feature extraction on the RFMiD dataset. The project employs fully connected layers for classifying images and incorporates a novel methodology that utilizes the CIELAB color space and integrates channel attention mechanisms within the ResNet50 architecture. 

The approach enhances the learning process by effectively capturing and prioritizing informative features, leading to improved classification performance. The project leverages Python, TensorFlow, ResNet Model, CIELAB Color Space, Matplotlib, and Google Colab.
